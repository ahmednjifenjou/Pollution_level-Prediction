# Pollution level rediction 


# Context

During a Data Mining class, we learnt about the Recurrent Neural Network and we want to assess their performance and show why they are more interesting than MLP(FFNN) while we work on sequential data.

Therefore, we were given a .csv file with several climate parameters(wind speed, temperature...) and the associated pollution level captured daily(hence a sequential dataset).

# Aims

Predict pollution level on day "t" using all the datas we have until day "t-1". We used a FFNN, Simple RNN and a LSTM and compared the Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and how they perform in predicting the pollution level. 

All the code and comments are done in the notebook in English
